You are looking for this:h1 span {border: 4px dashed #20bcd5;padding: 10px;}This tells your website to put a colored (#20bcd5) 4px dashed border with 10px padding around "My Coding Schedule".class="selected" is another CSS element.In the example above notice how some of the table boxes are orange.These are the cells that use class="selected" in the html file.Now, switch to the CSS tab. Here you will find a section like this:.selected {background-color: #f36f48;  <--- this is making the cells orangefont-weight: bold;color: white;}Your website knows to make those cells orange because you've told it to here. <div> is used to define a section, or blocklevel, of text.You can also style the whole <div> section with CSS.---‚óè If you want to add a title outside of the table, use: <caption> tag, immediately after the <table> tag.More info: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_caption.asp‚óè If you want to make a heading look like the title inside the table, then you can use: the 'colspan' attribute.For example:<th colspan="2">My Courses</th>This will make the header cell span two columns.More info: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_colspan.asp-->              <!--      The first li tag is not closed in the image sample but it IS closed in the code playground when you click "Try It Yourself" so don't worry about that üòäAnd for those who are confused with these 2 tags:‚óè The <a> tag, defines a hyperlink. It can be placed anywhere in the body of the document. It's used to link from one page to another. The 'href' attribute indicates the link's destination (the url)For example: --><a href="www.sololearn.com">Go To My Favorite Website</a><!-- The <link> tag, defines a link between a document and an external resource. It is placed in the head of the document. It is often used to link to external style sheets (this means, to your CSS document, the one that contains all the styling of your HTML document. Remember HTML is used only to create the structure of your website, not the design or style of the elements in it, that's CSS job)For example: --><link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">            <br>            <h1><span>Contact Me</span></h1>      <form>      	<input name="name" type="text"/><br>      	<input name="email" type="email"/> <br>      	<textarea name="message"></textarea>          <input type="submit" value="SEND" class="submit"/>       </form>            <!-- This is just a static HTML page, so it won't work to actually submit the form. You'd need to create the server-side code in order to submit a real form and process the data. To learn how, complete SoloLearn's PHP course once you've completed the HTML and CSS courses. ---small remark about the <textarea> element:when adding a placeholder to it:<textarea placeholder="Enter Text:">....MAKE SURE that the closing tag </textarea> is NOT seperated by any whitespace from the opening tag <textarea> !!!Bad (newline):<textarea placeholder="Enter Text:"></textarea>Bad also (space):<textarea placeholder="Enter Text:"> </textarea>Good (nothing seperating):<textarea placeholder="Enter Text:"></textarea>if it is seperated by newline, the placholder WILL NOT be shown!The reason behind this behaviour is that the content between the opening and closing tag is considered as the textarea initial value.so any whitespace (space, tab, enter) is considered as an initial value in the field (unlike <input/> which has a value attribute), making the placeholder dissappear until the value is cleared from the field.---For those wondering, to submit a form you would need to add the attributes 'action' and 'method' to the <form> tag.For example:<form action="my_data.php" method="post">With that code, if you click on the submit button, the input (your message) will be sent to a page on the server called "my_data.php", the method used in my example is 'post' but could've been 'get', you can find more info about these methods in the PHP course üòä or online: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_form_method.asp-->            <div class="section">      	<h1><span>My Media</span><h1>      	<iframe height="150" width="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/..." allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe>             </div>            <!--      <iframe> tag is used to display a web page within a web page. That's why, if the video (or other media) you want to show on your website is somewhere online, then iframes are a good option.But say your video isn't anywhere online and it's only hosted in your server with your HTML document, then you might want to use the <video> and <source> tags. For example:<video width="320" height="240" controls>  <source src="my_movie.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>-->                            </body></html>
