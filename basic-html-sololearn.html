Here I've modified the code a little for better understanding also, added some missing ones:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>first page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    	<!--
    It is advisable to use h1 or h2 for topic title and h3 for subtopic heading on web pages.  I learnt this tip while working on SEO of a WordPress blog. 
    For SEO (search engine optimization), never use h1 more than once per page. Also never break the structure, for example, don't use h1 then jump to h3. Finally, most websites almost never use headings below h3.
    -->
        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
        <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
        <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
        <h6>This is heading 6</h6>
        <hr /><!-- horizontal row ni end tag -->
        <br /><!--break row ni end tag -->
<!-- <br> and <br /> both can be used in html. but XHTML doesn't support <br>. so if you are planning to learn XHTML in the future, habit of using <br /> will be useful. -->


        <!-- Strong and Emphasised are semantic tags. Even though they show text as bold and italics, they have other purpose also.
        They can be used in understanding speech and pronounciation etc if used properly. 
		Browsers display <strong> as <b>, and <em> as <i>.
However, the meanings of these tags differ: <b> and <i> define bold and italic text, respectively, while <strong> and <em> indicate that the text is "important". -->
        <p>This is a Paragpraph</p>
        <p> This is another Paragraph </p>
        <p> This is <br /> a line break </p>
        <hr />
        <p>This is regular text</p>
        <p><b> bold text </b></p>
        <p><strong> strong text (has semantic meaning) </strong></p>
        <p><big> big text </big></p>
        <p><small> small text </small></p>
        <p><i> italic text </i></p>
        <p><em> emphasised text (has semantic meaning) </em></p>
        <p><sub> subscripted text H20 </sub></p>
        <!-- 
Superscript: X²
Subscript: H₂O
		-->
        <p><sup> superscripted text X2 </sup></p>
        <p><ins> inserted text </ins></p>
        <p><u> inserted or underlined text </u></p>
        <p><del>deleted text</del></p>
        <p><s> deleted or striked text </s></p>
        
        
        
        
    </body> 
</html>
