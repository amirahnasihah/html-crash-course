    It is advisable to use h1 or h2 for topic title and h3 for subtopic heading on web pages.  I learnt this tip while working on SEO of a WordPress blog. 
    For SEO (search engine optimization), never use h1 more than once per page. Also never break the structure, for example, don't use h1 then jump to h3. Finally, most websites almost never use headings below h3.
    -->
        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
        <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
        <h5>This is heading 5</h5>

        <!-- Strong and Emphasised are semantic tags. Even though they show text as bold and italics, they have other purpose also.
        They can be used in understanding speech and pronounciation etc if used properly. 
		Browsers display <strong> as <b>, and <em> as <i>.

However, the meanings of these tags differ: <b> and <i> define bold and italic text, respectively, while <strong> and <em> indicate that the text is "important". -->

        Attributes provide additional information about an element or a tag, while also modifying them. Most attributes have a value; the value modifies the attribute.

       <!--
       The align attribute of <p> is not supported in HTML5.
       
       There is no need of <br /> tag. 
<br /> tag is used for move to the next line without any space in between the lines.
		<hr /> tag has its own private line, you cannot type any text on "hr" line. Whenever you use <hr/> tag you'll be automatically redirect to next line to create a horizontal line. So using <br/> before <hr/> is useless.. 
		"This is a text" is aligned to center... But "This is also a text" is not aligned to center, even they both are in <p> means Paragraph tag. It is because in between this two sentences they have used <hr/> tag. 
         This type of tags (<hr/>) are self ended tags. And this tags terminate the previous attribute, and after applying this tags the previous attribute does not affect on the next text which is used after this (<hr/>) type of  tags. 
		That is why "This is also a text" is shifted to left side which is default.

       Now that we've gotten to attributes, here is a very important one. 

<html lang=" ">
	
This is used to set the language of the html page and is important for internationalization and SEO.

        <!-- An element's width can be defined using pixels or percentages. 
		Pay attention carefully about these two definitions , They're very tricky and look alike , but they're not the same and completely different , 50px means 50 pixels in measures , and does never change , but 50% means half of full width that your screen can take to show elements , and it's changing , because all of the users don't have the same sizes. -->

		Color does not work in border attribute. You can specify it as 2px , but you can't add a color.If one wants to stylized it like that, you have to use the 'style' attribute. You'd write it up like this in your 'img' tag: style="border: solid 2px red;"
This would then bring you into the wonderful world of css.

---        

		Re-sizing images has negative score in SEO ranks. and its better to use the original size. 
		
		It's better to edit the image instead of resizing because you will reduce the size (kiloBytes) of your page which will reduce bandwidth usage and make your page load faster.
		
		Never use html for styling, use css.
		
		There is a special image file format that was developed by Google which is intended to increase the efficiency of loading and rendering images. It's called WebP (and the file extension is .webp). The WebP format is so efficient that WebP images can be loaded and rendered almost instantaneously. Plenty of online tools can convert images to the WebP format, such as online-convert.com.

---
        
        In case the image cannot be displayed, the alt attribute specifies an alternate text that describes the image in words. The alt attribute is required.

---
        
        To add an image (even if it's not in the same folder as the html file) simply:
1) left-click the image
2) click on properties
3) now you can see "Location:"
4) copy that location and paste it after src attribute
5) add "\" and then write the name of the picture followed by ".jpg"
6) close the quotations and YOU ARE DONE!

---

		If you want to add a caption to your image use this form:

<figure>
        <img src="painting.jpg" alt="The Scream">
        <figcaption>
               <cite>The Scream</cite> by Edward Munch
        </figcaption>
</figure>

... where <cite> represents the title of the image (painting in this example).
<figure> usually represents an illustration and it's caption (figcaption).

--- 

		best way to do this;
*create a folder and name it "HTML codes", save all your codes here such as index.html etc

*then create another folder and name it "images"  and save the image you want to use Here with a name like "man"

*now go to your code where you want to attach the image and write your code like this
 <img  src="images/man.jpg" />
 
 ---
 
 IMPORTANT TIP:

Most images you will find online are copyrighted, so never ever just save an image from Google and use it on your website.

When you are browsing for a suitable image to use on your website, you can minimize your chances of violating copyright laws by clicking on "search tools"  and selecting "usage rights"

<ol type="a"> == counts from a, b, c etc.
type="A" == counts as A, B, C, D..

and if u type start="3" the count will start from 3, same goes for letters.

        There are four types of lists. (unordered list/ordered list/ description lists and horizontal list) 

since most have talked on the unordered list and ordered list, I want to share small on the description list and horizontal list.

Description list is a list of items with description for each item. 
1. the <dl> tag defines a list
2.the <dt> tag defines the item name 
3. the <dd> tag defines the description.  Example 

<html>
   <body>
     <h2> Description list</h2>
<dl>
   <dt>Tiger</dt>
    <dd> Tiger is a cat</dd>

    <dt> Lion</dt>
     <dd> Lion is the king of cats </dd>
</dl>

colspan (merge 2 columns)
rowslan (merge 2 rows)

---

for those who wonder:
1)why the <br /> is written between the <td> and the </td>
it's because we have no content in that column.
2)what does colspan attribute means..
it defines how much space does this column occupies,in our case it occupies the space of 2 columns.
and again we used the <br /> because even this column has no content in it.

---

when we change the value of colspan from 3 to 2 and then 1 we notice a difference. if we take that value upwards say 4 or 5 we don't notice anything new. this I believe informs us that colspan value change is limited to the number of specified rows. I.e col value cannot be greater than row value.

	<!--
	In HTML, most elements are defined as block level or inline elements.
Block level elements start from a new line. 
For example: <h1>, <form>, <li>, <ol>, <ul>, <p>, <pre>, <table>, <div>, etc.

Inline elements are normally displayed without line breaks. 
For example: <b>, <a>, <strong>, <img>, <input>, <em>, <span>, etc.

The <div> element is a block-level element that is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
When used together with some CSS styling, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:

---

The <div> tag is nothing more than a container unit that covers some page elements and divides the HTML document into sections.
In other words it just creates section(a paticular block) for your html page where you can put some text,images etc, etc, etc. 

---

Other elements can be used either as block level elements or inline elements. This includes the following elements:
APPLET - embedded Java applet
IFRAME - Inline frame
INS - inserted text
MAP - image  map
OBJECT - embedded object
SCRIPT - script within an HTML document

You can insert inline elements inside block elements. For example, you can have multiple <span> elements inside a <div> element.
Inline elements cannot contain any block level elements.

---

Here is what google says about each tag/element:

APPLET - Just inserts a java applet in the web page. Example:
<applet code="Bubbles.class">
Java applet that draws bubbles.
</applet>

IFRAME - Inline Frame - Inserts a webpage in a web page. Example:
<iframe src="https://www.sololearn.com/"></iframe>

INS - Defines inserted text in a document - You see underlined text by default. Example:
<p>Random <ins>extra</ins> text</p>

MAP - Use with an image to define clickable areas. 
Check out this example: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_areamap

OBJECT - Embed a object in a web page. Object can be: audio, video, Java/ActiveX applet, pdf, Flash etc.. Example:
<object data="flashAnimation.swf"></object>

SCRIPT - Insert a script. JavaScript by default. Example:
<script>
     alert("Hello World!")
</script>
